### Barware:
  * Bar spoon

### Glassware:
  * Old Fashioned glass

### Specs:
  *  1 1/2 oz. reposado tequila (suggestion: El Tesoro)
  *  1/2 oz. mezcal (suggestion: Del Maguey Chichicapa or San Luis del Rio)
  * 1 barspoon agave nectar
  * 2 dashes Angostura bitters

### Directions:
  1. Combine all the ingredients except the orange twist in an Old Fashioned glass filled with one large ice cube.
  2. Stir until chilled.
  3. To top with a flamed orange twist, carefully hold a piece of orange peel about the size of a silver dollar, skin side down, over the drink. Light a match and use it to warm the skin side of the peel. Holding the match a few inches above the drink, quickly squeeze the peel in the direction of the match. The oil from the peel will briefly ignite, landing over the drinkâ€™s surface.
